Look, I've made plenty of travel mistakes.
I once paid $10 for a bottle of water at an airport because I forgot to bring my own and didn't like the taste of the tap.
I've also wandered around London for three hours because I refused to pay for data roaming and didn't have an offline map downloaded.
So yeah, I've learned a few things the hard way, and I'm here to save you from my spectacular failures.

## Getting Around Without Going Broke

First up: Uber One. I know, I know, another subscription service trying to worm its way into your life.
But here's the thing: they usually offer a free trial period, and during that glorious window, you get discounted rides.
Just set a reminder on your phone to cancel before they start charging you.
I'm not saying to be that person, but I'm also not *not* saying it.

Speaking of free trials, let's talk VPNs.
Download one with a month-long trial, use it for your trip, then peace out before the charges hit.
Some VPN companies are basically giving away a month of service,
which is perfect for accessing your streaming services when you're stuck on an overnight bus for 18 hours.

## The Basics (That Aren't Actually That Basic)

Here's something I wish someone had told me earlier: get a water filter bottle.
Seriously. You can drink from practically any tap or stream without worrying about what's lurking in there.
No more panic-buying overpriced bottles at train stations or lugging around cases of water like you're prepping for the apocalypse.
Your wallet and your shoulders will thank you.

And those zip-off pants that turn into shorts? Yes, they look ridiculous. Yes, you should pack them anyway.
When you're sweating through a hike in Patagonia and the elements decide to test you the next minute, you'll understand.
Fashion is temporary, but being the right temperature is forever.

## Money Moves

Get yourself a travel credit card that includes Priority Pass. Airport lounges are basically heaven on earth when you're stuck in a six-hour layover.
Free food, free drinks, actual comfortable chairs, and most importantly, you're not eating a $17 sad airport sandwich while sitting on the floor next to Gate B47.

While you're at it, grab a debit card like Schwab that reimburses ATM fees. Foreign transaction fees are a scam, and I refuse to participate.
These cards give you great exchange rates too, so you're not getting fleeced every time you need cash.

If you want to check out some of these cards with rewards links, I've got them [here](https://christurgeon.com/referrals).
Shameless plug, I know, but hey, we both benefit and you were going to get one anyway, right?

## Tech That Actually Matters

Download Google Translate with the local language pack *before* you leave.
Trust me, trying to mime "Where's the bathroom?" in rural Malaysia is character-building, but not in a good way.
Also, download offline maps of wherever you're going.
Cell service is spotty, data is expensive, and getting lost stops being charming after the first hour.

Put an AirTag in your luggage. Airlines have a special talent for sending bags on surprise vacations to completely different continents.
At least with an AirTag, you'll know your stuff is living it up in Dubai while you're shivering in Oslo.

## Packing Like You Know What You're Doing

Packing cubes are the answer to a question you didn't know you had.
Everything stays organized, you can actually find your socks, and repacking takes minutes instead of the usual game of Tetris where nothing fits and you end up sitting on your suitcase.

Bring a padlock for hostel lockers and to secure your bags. I'm not saying the world is full of thieves,
but I'm also not naive enough to think everyone respects the honor system.

Also, throw a carabiner on your backpack. You can clip extra stuff to it when your bag is full,
which happens approximately 10 minutes into any trip when you start buying ridiculous souvenirs you definitely don't need.

## The Social Stuff

Stay in hostels when you can. Yes, you might have to deal with someone's 3 a.m. snack-crunching,
but you'll also meet people from around the world who can tell you where the actual good food is (not the tourist traps).
Hostel staff are usually locals with insider knowledge, which beats any guidebook.

Join the free walking tours as soon as you arrive somewhere new.
They're actually free (tip your guide, though), and you'll learn way more than you would stumbling around solo.
Plus, you might make friends to grab dinner with later.

If you're traveling with a group, use Splitwise or a similar app.
Nobody wants to be the person with a napkin full of calculations at the end of the trip,
trying to figure out who owes what for that one lunch three weeks ago.

## The Boring But Important Stuff

Get travel insurance. I resisted this for years because I'm young and invincible and what could possibly go wrong?
Then I went on a 3-day bender in Thailand and suddenly a hospital visit seemed like a real possibility.
Also, if you're carrying expensive camera gear or laptops, insurance is your friend.

Bring a portable charger. Bonus points if it's solar-powered, though let's be real,
you'll probably just charge it in your hostel like a normal person.
Your phone will die at the worst possible moment (usually when you need directions or your boarding pass), so be prepared.

Finally, and this might be the most important one: clean out your wallet before you leave.
You don't need three different grocery store loyalty cards and that punch card for the frozen yogurt place in your hometown.
Travel light, travel smart.

## The End

There you have it. Not all of these tips are glamorous, and some of them make you look like a total dork (looking at you, zip-off pants).
But they work, they save money, and they'll help you avoid at least some of the rookie mistakes I've made over the years.

Now go forth and travel. Try not to pay $10 for water.
