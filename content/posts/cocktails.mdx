I've never been one for overly complicated drinks with fourteen ingredients and a foam on top.
The cocktails I return to again and again tend to be simple, balanced, and rooted in tradition.
Some I discovered while traveling, others within the numerous excellent cocktail bars in New York City.
This is my personal reference, a collection of recipes I've made enough times to nearly commit to memory,
now written down so I stop second-guessing measurements at 7 p.m. on a Friday.

The drinks are organized by base spirit. Within each section, I've included not just the ingredients but the technique, the glassware, and any notes I've picked up along the way.

## Glassware Glossary

Before diving into the recipes, a quick primer on glassware. The right glass isn't just presentation — it affects temperature, aroma, and how you experience the drink.

**[Coupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_coupe)** — A stemmed glass with a broad, shallow bowl. Originally designed for champagne, it's now the go-to for stirred and shaken cocktails served up (without ice). Elegant and classic.

**[Nick & Nora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_%26_Nora_glass)** — A smaller, more rounded alternative to the coupe, named after the cocktail-loving couple from *The Thin Man* films. Holds about 5–6 oz, which helps keep drinks cold since you finish them faster.

**[Rocks Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_glass)** — Also called an Old Fashioned glass or lowball. A short, sturdy tumbler used for spirits served neat or on the rocks, and for cocktails like the Margarita or Old Fashioned.

**[Highball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highball_glass)** — A tall, narrow glass for drinks with a higher ratio of mixer to spirit. The Chilcano, Gin & Tonic, and Whiskey Soda all belong here.

**[Wine Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_glass)** — For cocktails like the Spritz, a large wine glass works best. The wide bowl gives room for ice and garnish, and the stem keeps your hand from warming the drink.

## Agave Spirits

### Margarita

The margarita is one of those drinks that's easy to get wrong. Skip the neon-green mixes and sugary shortcuts. A proper margarita is tart, slightly bitter from the orange liqueur, and balanced by the smokiness of mezcal or the brightness of blanco tequila.

**Ingredients**
- 2 oz mezcal or blanco tequila
- 1 oz Cointreau
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

**Method**

Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for 12–15 seconds until the shaker is frosty cold. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice. If you want a salted rim, run a lime wedge around half the rim and dip it in flaky salt before pouring — I prefer salting only half so you can choose with each sip.

**Glass:** Rocks glass

**Notes:** Mezcal adds a smoky depth that I prefer, but a quality blanco tequila works beautifully. Fresh lime juice is non-negotiable.

## Whiskey

### Manhattan

The Manhattan is stirred, never shaken. It's a drink that rewards patience and good ingredients. Rye whiskey gives it a spicier backbone than bourbon would, and the sweet vermouth rounds everything out.

**Ingredients**
- 2 oz rye whiskey
- 3/4 oz sweet (red) vermouth
- 1 dash Angostura bitters
- Maraschino cherry for garnish

**Method**

Add the whiskey, vermouth, and bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir gently for about 30 seconds — you want to chill and dilute the drink without aerating it. Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass. Drop in a cherry.

**Glass:** Coupe or Nick & Nora

**Notes:** Keep your vermouth in the refrigerator after opening. It's a wine and will oxidize. A good cherry matters too — Luxardo or Amarena, not the bright red ones from a jar.

---

### Black Manhattan

A darker, more brooding cousin of the classic. Swapping sweet vermouth for amaro gives this drink a bitter, herbal complexity that I find myself craving in colder months.

**Ingredients**
- 2 oz rye whiskey
- 1 oz amaro (Averna works well)
- 1 dash Angostura bitters
- Maraschino cherry for garnish

**Method**

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass with ice. Stir for about 30 seconds until well chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a cherry.

**Glass:** Coupe or Nick & Nora

**Notes:** The amaro you choose will significantly change the drink's character. Averna is the classic choice — bitter and slightly sweet with notes of orange and herbs.

---

### Paper Plane

The Paper Plane is a modern classic, created in 2007. It follows an equal-parts formula that's easy to remember and surprisingly well-balanced. The bourbon provides warmth, the Aperol adds bittersweet citrus, the amaro contributes depth, and the lemon juice ties it all together.

**Ingredients**
- 3/4 oz bourbon
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 3/4 oz amaro (Nonino is traditional)
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice

**Method**

Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake hard for 12–15 seconds. Double strain into a chilled coupe to catch any ice chips or pulp.

**Glass:** Coupe

**Notes:** The equal-parts ratio makes this one easy to scale up for batches. Amaro Nonino is the traditional choice, but Averna or Montenegro work in a pinch.

## Pisco

I fell in love with pisco while traveling through Peru, where these drinks were everywhere — from the bustling bars of Lima to quiet spots in the countryside. Peru and Chile have a friendly (sometimes not-so-friendly) rivalry over who makes it best. I'll stay out of that debate and just say: drink more pisco.

### Pisco Sour

The pisco sour is the flagship cocktail of South America. The egg white gives it a silky, frothy texture that transforms the drink into something elegant. If you're not into raw egg whites, you can make a frozen version without it — still delicious, just different.

**Ingredients**
- 1 1/2 oz pisco
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 1 egg white (optional — see notes)
- Angostura bitters for garnish

**Method**

If using egg white, start with a dry shake: combine the pisco, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white in a shaker *without* ice. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds to emulsify the egg white. Then add ice and shake again for another 12–15 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe. Drop 3–4 dots of Angostura bitters on the foam and drag a toothpick through them to create a simple pattern.

**Glass:** Coupe

**Notes:** For a frozen variation, skip the egg white and blend the other ingredients with ice. You can also experiment with additions: a few calafate berries, fresh mint, a slice of ginger, or basil leaves muddled in before shaking.

### Chilcano

The chilcano is lighter and more refreshing than the pisco sour — essentially a pisco highball with ginger ale. It's what I reach for when I want something easy and effervescent.

**Ingredients**
- 2 oz pisco
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Ginger ale, chilled, to top
- 2 drops Angostura bitters

**Method**

Add the pisco and lime juice to a highball glass filled with ice. Top with cold ginger ale and stir gently once or twice. Add the bitters on top — they'll float and add aroma with each sip.

**Glass:** Highball

**Notes:** Use a good ginger ale with real ginger flavor, not the overly sweet stuff. Fever-Tree or Q Ginger Ale work well.

---

### Capitán

Think of the Capitán as a pisco Manhattan. It's spirit-forward and aromatic, with the bitters adding complexity. A great choice when you want something strong and contemplative.

**Ingredients**
- 2 oz pisco
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 3 drops Angostura bitters

**Method**

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass with ice. Stir for about 30 seconds until chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass.

**Glass:** Coupe or rocks glass

**Notes:** As with any stirred drink, the quality of your vermouth matters. Keep it refrigerated.

## Aperitivo

### Spritz

The spritz is more of a formula than a strict recipe. The classic ratio is 3-2-1: three parts sparkling wine, two parts bitter liqueur, one part soda. Aperol gives you something lighter and sweeter; Campari makes it more bitter and assertive. I lean toward Campari, but both have their place.

**Ingredients**
- 3 oz prosecco
- 2 oz Aperol or Campari
- 1 oz soda water
- Orange slice for garnish

**Method**

Fill a large wine glass with ice. Add the prosecco first, then the Aperol or Campari, then top with soda water. Give it one gentle stir. Garnish with an orange slice.

**Glass:** Large wine glass

**Notes:** Build this directly in the glass — no shaking or stirring required beyond that one gentle mix. The order matters: prosecco first helps maintain the bubbles. This drink is meant to be leisurely, served before dinner as the sun goes down.

## A Few General Notes

**On ice:** Use large cubes or spheres for stirred drinks served on the rocks. They melt slower and dilute less. For shaking, standard ice cubes are fine.

**On fresh juice:** Always squeeze your citrus fresh. Bottled lime and lemon juice taste flat and artificial. It takes thirty seconds and makes all the difference.

**On chilling glasses:** Pop your coupes and Nick & Nora glasses in the freezer for a few minutes before serving. A cold glass keeps the drink colder longer.

**On measuring:** Use a jigger. Eyeballing works for some things in life, but cocktail ratios aren't one of them. The balance between sweet, sour, and spirit is everything.

Cheers.
